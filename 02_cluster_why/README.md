# Why Use Matlida Clusters?

In a nutshell, our clusters are here for the moment your personal computer can no longer handle the computations you need to get done.

## Reasons to Use the Clusters

Some advantages of using the clusters are:

- Lots of processing capacity, ability to do parallel computing (e.g., you could use 1000 CPU-cores for a single job)  
- Lots of memory (i.e., nodes have 100's GB of memory and in one case greater than 1.5 TB)
- Ability to work with large datasets (on `/scratch/users/netid` or on `/scratch/projects/project_name`, see working_with_files directory)
- Lots of software is available and already configured (e.g., MPI, compilers, commercial software)
- Keep your laptop free to use by running your work on the clusters
- GPUs are available on all of the GPU nodes
- There is a team of people maintaining and supporting the clusters
